<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>PLAY aims to set new standards for conducting open, transparent, and reproducible behavioral science by i) publishing the protocol, and ii) making extensive use of video exemplars to demonstrate phenomena and illustrate behavioral codes. For confidentiality reasons, access to video exemplars is restricted to researchers with authorized access to <a href="http://databrary.org">Databrary</a>. To register for access, visit <a href="http://databrary.org/register" class="uri">http://databrary.org/register</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="participant-inclusionexclusion-criteria" class="section level1">
<h1>Participant Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</h1>
<p>Infants’ natural play in the home is characterized by tremendous variability including variations in: geographic location, climate, SES, maternal/paternal employment, childcare experiences, infants’ and mothers’ ages, language environment, physical layout and characteristics of the home, availability of media, toys for play, and so on. Researchers will be able to explore the effects of any/all such factors.</p>
<p>However, to ensure a sufficient sample size and based on conversations with the launch group, we will limit variability along several dimensions. To be included in the PLAY sample of 900 sessions, participants must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>From two-parent or single-parent households</li>
<li>The mother must act as the caregiver during the one-hour natural interaction, which will be scheduled at a time when only the mother and infant are present.</li>
<li>English or Spanish monolingual or bilingual (i.e., no other language exposure in the home)</li>
<li>The firstborn child (i.e., only child in the household)</li>
<li>12, 18, or 24 months of age (+/- 1 week)</li>
<li>Born full-term (37-40 weeks) without known disabilities</li>

<p>Hi, may I speak with [MOM]?</p>
<p>My name is [CALLER NAME] and I’m calling from [LAB] about a home study where we’re looking at how moms and babies interact with each other. We’d be visitng your home and you’d receive $25 at the end of the visit for your participation. Can we tell you about it?</p>
<p>First, I have some questions to see if you and [CHILD] qualify for the study.</p>
<p>Does [CHILD]have any siblings?</p>
<ul>
<li>→ <em>If yes: <strong>end call</strong>.</em> In this study, we are currently looking for only-children. Would it be alright if we contacted you for other studies in the future?</li>
<li>→ <em>If no: continue</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What language(s) do you speak to [CHILD]?</p>
<ul>
<li>→ <em>If not ENGLISH or SPANISH: <strong>end call</strong>.</em> To control for differences in communication, we are looking for families who speak mainly English or Spanish. Would it be alright if we contacted you for other studies in the future?</li>
<li>→ <em>If yes: continue</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Was [CHILD] born on his/her due date? (If not: “How many weeks and days early/late was he/she?”)</p>
<ul>
<li>→ <em>If more than 4 weeks early: end call.</em> In this study, we are currently looking for children born on term. Would it be alright if we contacted you for other studies in the future?</li>
<li>→ <em>If born on term (37-41 weeks): continue</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For this study, we are interested in learning about babies’ natural, everyday experiences in their homes. A researcher will visit you and [CHILD] in your home for about 2.5 hours. You and [CHILD] will be video recorded for 1 hour as you go about your day, followed by questions on [CHILD]’s skills and routines. We will ask you to take us through your home as we record the environment. For your participation, we will compensate you with $25 at the end of the session.</p>
<p>The data collected in this study are valuable and will be placed in a secure web-based library available only to researchers. The purpose is to share the data with experts in the field so that scientists can learn more about infant development.</p>
<p>Does this sound like something you would be interested in participating in with [CHILD]?</p>
<p>→ <em>If no to study or to sharing video on Databrary:</em> Okay, thank you. May we call you for other studies?</p>
<p>→ <em>If yes:</em> Great! Because we are interested in mother-infant routines, we’d like to find a time and date when we can observe just <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>you and [CHILD]</strong></span> at home. It would be great if we can schedule a time that is not during a typical mealtime and when [CHILD] is usually awake. Is there a convenient time and day that works best for you that would be within these criteria?</p>
<p>→ <em>If the date they are available puts baby out of age range:</em> For this study, we are interested in studying specific age groups: 12-, 18-, and 23-month olds. Would it be possible for us to contact you in XX months to see if [CHILD] can participate then?</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Before the study, we have a few questions that we’d like to ask. It should only take about 5 minutes. We can either ask you now or when we call to confirm the study. What would you prefer?</li>
</ul>
<p>→ <em>If yes:</em></p>
<p>Just as a reminder, the data we collect from you now and during the visit, will be shared on a web-based library only available to researchers like the professor who runs this lab.</p>
<ul>
<li>On your tablet, open Kobo toolbox and start a new questionnaire set</li>
<li>Fill out participant information at top of new session</li>
<li>“Save as Draft” after Phone Questionnaire and home visit questionnaires</li>
<li>Only hit “Submit” after filling out clean-up notes back in lab</li>
</ul>

<p>→ <em>If no:</em> Proceed with wrapping up the call:</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>So I have you and [CHILD] for our study on [DATE] at [TIME]. We’ll be calling you the day before (if study is on Monday: the Friday before) your appointment to confirm that that time still works for you. Have a great day!</li>
<li>If the date they are available puts baby out of age range: For this study, we are interested in studying specific age groups: 12-, 18-, and 23-month olds. Would it be possible for us to contact you in XX months to see if [CHILD] can participate then? → If no to study or to sharing video on Databrary: Okay, thank you. May we call you for other studies?</li>
</ul>
<p>→ If no: Okay, thank you. May we call you for other studies?  </p>

<p>“For the next hour, do anything you would typically do if I weren’t here. Try to ignore me as much as possible and I will stay out of the way. I will also try not to respond to you and [CHILD] so that he/she is not distracted. You can go anywhere in your home. You can play together or not. The idea is to capture what your typical day is like.”</p>
</div>
<div id="procedure" class="section level5">
<h5>Procedure:</h5>

<li>Keep camera on the child at all times. Specifically, ensure that the child’s whole body is visible on camera. If mom is in frame, capture as much of her body as possible without compromising view of the child.</li>
<li>Record in front or to the side of the child as much as possible.</li>
<li>Do not zoom in.</li>
<li>Remain at as far a distance as possible (~3 to 5 m, hugging the wall) so that the child is not distracted by your presence.</li>
<li>Try not to interact with the child or make eye contact with the child. Just watch through the view finder of the camera.</li>

<h4>Video House Walkthrough</h4>
<div id="instructions-1" class="section level5">
<h5>Instructions:</h5>
<p>“Now, we would like to see the space that [CHILD] gets to explore throughout the day. Please give me a tour of your home as I follow with a camera, and take measurements of the spaces. As we walk around, please show me where you keep any objects — toys, books, sippy cups, anything like that — that [CHILD] might interact with regularly. Please show me where you keep his/her clothes to give us an idea of the kinds of things he/she wears.”</p>
</div>
<div id="procedure-video" class="section level5">
<h5>Procedure (Video):</h5>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Experimenter should watch recording through camcorder screen to ensure that the view is not blurry or shaky. Move the camera slowly and walk slowly. A clear and steady view, free of blurriness and shakiness, is necessary for detailed coding of the home environment.</li>
<li>Ensure during the house walkthrough that the parent provides information on all of the following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Children’s Sleeping Arrangements.</em> If parent does not offer information during walkthrough, say “Please show me where [CHILD] typically sleeps.”</li>
<li><em>Child’s Clothes.</em> If parent does not offer information during walkthrough, say “Please show me where you keep [CHILD]’s clothes.”</li>

<li>Pause at the entrance of the room.</li>
<li>Name the room by its function (e.g., “This is where [CHILD] sleeps”).</li>
<li>First, get as much of the ** <em>Entire Room</em> ** in frame as possible. Keep the camera zoomed out and make sure to capture the ceiling and the floor of the room.</li>
<li>Next, pan the camera SLOWLY from ** <em>Left to Right</em> **.</li>
<li>Then, pan the camera to ** <em>Floor</em> <strong>, name the different types of surfaces in the space (hardwood, plush carpet, thin rug, linoleum, tile, etc.), and then pan to the </strong> <em>Ceiling</em> **.</li>
<li>Hold the camera in one hand while you take measurements of the room.</li>
<li>If parent doesn’t offer information, ask parent if child spends time in each room: “Does [CHILD] spend any time in this room?”</li>
<li>When parent doesn’t offer information, ask parent about child’s objects in the room: “Do you keep anything for [CHILD] in this room? (If yes:) Would you mind showing me?”</li>
<li>Experimenter should film the ** <em>Location</em> ** of the storage space (drawer, toy chest, cabinet) in clear context of the rest of the room. Then, SLOWLY and CLEARLY film the ** <em>Contents</em> ** of the storage space to show what is inside of it, zooming in if needed. (Overhead view for bed, crib, drawers, toy chest, etc.; Zoomed in side view for cabinet, closet, bookshelf, etc.)</li>
