<h2>D. EARLY CHILDHOOD BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE (ECBQ) – VERY SHORT FORM (ROTHBART)</h2>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Please read carefully before starting. [PURPLE SCALE] As you read each description of the child’s behavior below, please indicate how often the child did this during the last two weeks by circling one of the numbers in the right column. These numbers indicate how often you observed the behavior described during the last two weeks. less very than half never rarely the time about half the time more than half almost does not the time always always apply 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NA</p>
<p>The “Does Not Apply” column (NA) is used when you did not see the child in the situation described during the last two weeks. For example, if the situation mentions the child going to the doctor and there was no time during the last two weeks when the child went to the doctor, circle the (NA) column. “Does Not Apply” (NA) is different from “NEVER” (1). “Never” is used when you saw the child in the situation but the child never engaged in the behavior mentioned in the last two weeks. Please be sure to circle a number or NA for every item.</p>
