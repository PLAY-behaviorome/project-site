# Goals of the project

Play is the primary context for infant learning and is foundational for all domains of healthy development—cognition, language, social interaction, motor action, and emotion. Before children begin formal schooling, play occupies nearly all of their waking day. In the first years of life, play provides an unparalleled window into typical and atypical patterns of development, and it is an ideal context for understanding development in children around the globe.

Video uniquely captures the nuances and details of natural behavior and the surrounding context, and video can be used and reused by experts in multiple domains.

The Play & Learning Across A Year (PLAY) project will create a large-scale shared corpus of video of natural infant play from homes in varied locations across the U.S. Researchers with expertise in multiple domains of infant behavior (physical and motor development, communication and gesture, object exploration and play, emotion, gender, home environment, media) will contribute to the collection and coding of these videos, and will use the data to address questions about infant learning and development. The shared corpus will ultimately be shared with the entire research community.

<!-- The Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project serves as a model system for doing development science from a “big data” approach.  -->
<!-- Natural free play represents the foundation of infant learning, but we know little about how infants play, how play unfolds in real time and across development, and how individual and group differences promote infant learning and development through play.  -->
<!-- To answer these questions, the PLAY project will collect, code, and share 900 hours of video collected in the homes of children at 12, 18, and 24 months of age drawn from 30 sites across North America. -->

<!-- The aim of the project is to develop a new approach to developmental science that enables: (1) “big data“ science for researchers who would not otherwise have access; (2) a communal, low-cost means of collecting and coding data that retains the autonomy of individual labs; and (3) a plan for leveraging diverse expertise to address a common goal. -->

Materials (videos, questionnaires, links to Databrary) for the PLAY project are included in this site.
We document data collection protocols, workflows, coding strategies, and operational definitions.
